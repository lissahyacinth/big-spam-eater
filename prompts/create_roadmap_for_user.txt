**Required Structure:**

**Opening (2-3 sentences):** 
Getting your first DS job isn't about knowing everythingâ€”it's about proving you can solve problems similar to what your target companies face. Pick your lane early: B2B SaaS needs churn prediction and revenue forecasting, e-commerce needs recommendation systems, fintech needs transaction categorization.

**Phase 1 - Tool Proficiency (Weeks 1-6):**
Python for Data Analysis (focus on pandas/numpy) + complete 3 Kaggle Learn modules. You're ready when you can manipulate data without constantly checking documentation.

**Phase 2 - Pick Your Industry (Weeks 7-8):**
Research 10 companies you'd work for. What problems do they solve? Find their engineering blogs. Your projects should mirror their challenges, not random Kaggle datasets.

**Phase 3 - First Relevant Project (Weeks 9-16):**
Build something your target companies care about using Fast.ai or Made With ML patterns. E-commerce? Recommendation engine (see Aggarwal). Fintech? Transaction categorization using your own bank exports (see Klaas). B2B SaaS? Churn prediction or revenue forecasting (see FPP3). Document your reasoning, not just results.

**Phase 4 - Communication Practice (Weeks 17-20):**
Create visualizations (Fundamentals of Data Visualization) explaining your project to non-technical audiences. Record yourself presenting it. This matters more than another algorithm.

**Phase 5 - Depth Building (Weeks 21-24):**
ISL for statistical foundations (more accessible than ESL), then domain-specific books (FPP3 for time series, Aggarwal for RecSys, Klaas for Finance). Second project iterating on feedback from showing your first project to practitioners.

**Job Application Readiness:**
- Fluent in pandas, numpy, and one of PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Two projects solving problems your target companies actually have
- Can explain technical work to both engineers and product managers
- Can articulate why you made specific technical choices

**Word limit:** 250-300 words
**Tone:** Strategic, practical, industry-focused
